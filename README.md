# StokesMFS
_StokesMFS_ is three-dimensional Stokes-flow solver that uses the Method of Fundamental Solutions (MFS). It can simulate almost any arbitrary particle with vanishing Reynolds number. This work is a Python implementation of some of the methodology published in: Josiah J.P. Jordan and Duncan A. Lockerby. “The method of fundamental solutions for multi-particle Stokes flows: Application to a ring-like array of spheres”. In: _Journal of Computational Physics_ 520 (2025), p. 113487. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113487. The main focus of this repository is flow visualisation.
